Trainig files for Australian Politicians Face Detection. MobileNet based on keras pretrained weights on ImageNet, ResNet50 and VGG-16 based on pretrained weights of [keras-vgg](https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface)
For testing the models check evaluation notebook. For Retraining, create directory named `Data` in as a sibling of the files. `Data` should containg subfolders named as target labels each of which containing photos of each target class(e.g. `./Data/Scott_Morrison/image1.jpg`).
