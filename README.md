# Australian-Politician-Face-Recognition

This repository contains the source code for COMP90055 project Australian Politician Face Recognition.

This project aims to develop a deep learning based system for recognition of the faces of the 225 members of the 45th Australian parliament. The outputs of the project contain an Android application for real-time face recognition of the targeted people using the mobile camera, and a Docker image that yields the same results in near real-time for all clients that request such service over a RESTful API. 

The source code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with a NVIDIA Tesla K80 12GB GPU.
