# Australian politician recognition project

This is a project on recognizing [225 australian politicians](https://github.com/billyZhang666/Australian-politician-recognition/blob/master/tflite/app/src/main/assets/label_225.txt).

The project is heavily inspired by the [TensorFlow Lite flower demo](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/tree/master/android/tflite).

The project is based on the VGG-16 model and Google Mobile Service(GMS). TensorFlow Lite is used to convert the fine-tuned VGG-16 model and GMS is used to detect the face positions.

The application is developed on the Android Studio and the minimum target SDK version is 21.
